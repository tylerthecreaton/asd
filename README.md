# asd

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Health checks

Run these commands before committing to make sure the project stays healthy:

```powershell
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

> Note: The current `file_picker` dependency emits platform plugin warnings on Windows, macOS, and Linux during the commands above. They are upstream notices and do not block analysis or tests.
